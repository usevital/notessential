          "Even without considering that, bundling lots of features into one mod defeats the purpose of a mod loader (to load mods with only the features you want). And with the features it does have, they seem to be at least semi-random and doesn't really make sense to bundle into one mod.",
          "It's also advertised more as a client than a mod, even though it is a mod, and because clients are locked-down with lots of features that don't make sense together if they were a mod instead, it could explain the seemingly random bundle of features that are in Essential."

          "This can also lead to a massive security issue, as should Essential's servers get compromised, these mods will unknowingly be including a potential RAT (remote access trojan), which is a big problem within the Minecraft modding community. This was brought up during the discussion of fractureiser, a Minecraft RAT that was detected during June 2023, which also caused Essential to disable their auto-update feature by default and make their mod source-available.",
