          "Even without considering that, bundling lots of features into one mod defeats the purpose of a mod loader (to load mods with only the features you want). And with the features it does have, they seem to be at least semi-random and doesn't really make sense to bundle into one mod.",
          "It's also advertised more as a client than a mod, even though it is a mod, and because clients are locked-down with lots of features that don't make sense together if they were a mod instead, it could explain the seemingly random bundle of features that are in Essential."

          "While maybe some players might get interested in the mod and check it out, the reality is that after a while they won't even use the features of Essential or only a marginal subset of it which would be better if they were split up.",
          "This can also lead to a massive security issue, as should Essential's servers get compromised, these mods will unknowingly be including a potential RAT (remote access trojan), which is a big problem within the Minecraft modding community. This was brought up during the discussion of fractureiser, a Minecraft RAT that was detected during June 2023, which also caused Essential to disable their auto-update feature by default and make their mod source-available.",
