      For multiplayer with a friends system, you can use World Host. It's a free
      and open source way to broadcast your world to those on your friends list,
      and everyone you want to share it with.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has a friends list system you can use to let your friends join your
      game right as you open it to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      You simply hit "Open to Friends" and your friends will be able to join.
      You can also share the link that appears in chat with the people you want
      to play with!
    </p>
    <p>
      This mod is recommended for mostly vanilla or lightly/client-side modded
      instances only. For better experiences with modpacks, use e4mc, which is
      featured below.

      For Multiplayer, you can use E4MC. It's a free and open source way to
      broadcast your LAN server to everyone you want to share it with.
    </p>
    <p>
      You simply hit "Open to LAN" and share the link that appears in chat with
      the people you want to play with!
    </p>
    <p>
      e4mc is recommended over World Host for modpacks, as this is a very simple
      mod which means it shouldn't interfere with potential mods. Just make sure
      your modlists are identical to avoid de-syncing!

      player model.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has an interface where you can add, remove, modify, model and texture

    </p>
    <p>
      The models are stored in unused space on your Minecraft Skin, or as a Gist
      on GitHub.

      If you're looking to step it up a notch, Figura allows you to modify your
      player model much more!
    </p>
    <p>
      Figura focuses less on maintaining compatibility, which means it's able to
      add much more to your model, such as pets, ears, and more! You can also
      use Lua scripts to customise even further!
    </p>
    <p>
      Bonus: It also has sort of a built-in anti-cheat for things such as
      invisible player models!

      for you!

    <p>
      If the server has Skin Shuffle installed, you can also switch your skin
      and it will be shown to everyone on the server, even those without the
