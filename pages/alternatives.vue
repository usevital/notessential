            Customizable Player Models is a mod that lets you deeply modify your player model.
            
        </ProjectParagraph>
        <ProjectParagraph>

            It has an interface where you can add, remove, modify, model and texture your own player model, similar to how Blender works.

        </ProjectParagraph>
        <ProjectParagraph>

            The models are stored in unused space on your Minecraft Skin, or as a Gist on GitHub.

        </ProjectParagraph>
        <ProjectParagraph>

            Upload the exported image file as your skin to load the custom model.

        <ProjectParagraph>
            
            If you're looking to step it up a notch, Figura allows you to modify your player model much more!

        </ProjectParagraph>
        <ProjectParagraph>

            Figura focuses less on maintaining compatibility, which means it's able to add much more to your model, such as pets, ears, and more! You can also use Lua scripts to customise even further!

        </ProjectParagraph>
        <ProjectParagraph>

            Bonus: It also has sort of a built-in anti-cheat for things such as invisible player models!
